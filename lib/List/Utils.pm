=head1 NAME

List::Utils - Use List::Util instead

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Do not use this
    # use List::Utils;


=head1 DESCRIPTION


There is a module L<List::Util> in Scalar-List-Util.
Some people tend to mistype it and try to use C<List::Utils>.

This module is just a placeholder until someone wants to create a module
with this name that actually makes sense.
Talk to me :)
